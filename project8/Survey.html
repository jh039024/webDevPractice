        <h2>History</h2>
        <p>In the Beginning ...
        Ted and Betty Russon have been happily married for 30 years.  They look back on their honeymoon at Arches National Monument with great fondness.  They have tried to keep the same spice in their marriage as they found on their honeymoon.  This amazing couple 
        make it a practice to try out new extreme sports together, just for the fun of it.  Their own honeymoon consisted of a wild mountain biking adventure in the beautiful slick red rock near Moab, Utah and through Arches National Monument.  On this same trip they also spent 3 days white water rafting down the Colorado River.
        </p>
